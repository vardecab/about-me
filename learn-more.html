            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                A short career, but how dynamic! It started with being a
                <span class="highlight">one-man-army doing IT in a non-profit environment</span>
                where among other things I did
                <span class="highlight">web dev, implementation of analytics and new services
                    (G Suite, DigitalOcean, Slack, Freshdesk)</span>
                and training for a team of several people. During this
                episode it turned out that I'm doing some growth. I was
                hooked on the subject and already
                <span class="highlight">as a growth hacker/marketer (one of the first in
                    Poland</span>
                - those were the times!) and
                <span class="highlight">employee #1 in Growth Engine agency</span>
                I helped guys grew the company and I think we did quite
                well.
                <span class="highlight">After 6 months we went through M&A with
                    <a href="https://try.ladder.io/" target="_blank">Ladder Digital</a></span>, one of the most well
                known growth marketing agencies in
                the world, where I
                <span class="highlight">currently work as Head of the Paid Social</span>. After hours,
                <span class="highlight">I'm an Asana Ambassador, TEDx conference organizer,
                    marketing consultant and a proud student at
                    <a href="https://www.sgh.waw.pl/en/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">SGH Warsaw School of
                        Economics</a></span>
                (#1 business school in Poland, #69 in Europe).
            </p>
            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Paid advertising is my T-shaped Marketer's stem</span>
                - thanks to tests with many customers, 5 & 6-figure ad
                budgets and being in touch with account managers from
                Facebook, Google and LinkedIn I know the latest tricks, the
                best ad formats, the most effective methods of campaign
                optimization and account management - but I also like to
                work on
                <span class="highlight">CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization), analytics (tracking
                    and data-based reasoning), automations and
                    strategy</span>. In my career I have been able to immerse myself in many
                of the elements that make up the T-shaped Marketer.
            </p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">I pay a <strong>lot</strong> of attention to
                    details</span>
                using the Pareto method - I know that usually 80% of the
                results can be achieved in 20% of the time. However, if the
                task at hand must be done top-notch I spend remaining 80% of
                the time to crush it.
                <span class="highlight">I approach strategy having in mind growth (AAARRR),
                    AIDA and AICIEP funnels, data and KPIs</span>. I like to
                <span class="highlight">automate things using Zapier and IFTTT and I'm a tools,
                    planning and productivity freak</span>.
            </p>
